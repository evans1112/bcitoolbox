# BCI Toolbox: Bayesian Causal Inference

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1.3-blue)

BCI Toolbox is a Python implementation of the hierarchical Bayesian Causal Inference (BCI) model for multisensory research. The BCI model is a statistical framework for understanding the causal relationships between sensory inputs and prior expectations of a common cause, which can account for human perception in various tasks.

## Installation

BCI Toolbox is available via pip. To install, run the following command:
```bash
python -m pip install bcitoolbox
